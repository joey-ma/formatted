# Publishing a package

## Set up

`npm adduser` will allow you to log in on your browser.

# Publish

`npm publish` publishes a package to the registry so that it can be installed by name. This include making updates to an already published package.

The process should require you to authenticate your account.

# SemVer

Remember to follow semantic versioning. You can do so either with:

`npm version patch` or `npm version minor`
